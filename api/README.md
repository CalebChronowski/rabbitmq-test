# Description

The api service serves as our external access point to the data streams, as well as a rudimentary system for user controls. I expect this to be replaced relatively soon into the development cycle.

## Notes

I relied heavily on [this random example off github](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO-Chat/blob/master/app/templates/chat.html) as well as [this dubious tutorial](https://tutorials.technology/tutorials/61-Create-an-application-with-websockets-and-flask.html)
